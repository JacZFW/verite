# Verite Wallet

## Getting Started

See the [Setting up the development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) documentation for React Native CLI.

The instructions suggest using the default system ruby, but it works just as well with a version manager such as asdf.

First run and after updating dependencies, you will need to update NPM and CocoaPod dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Install Expo Go

Install [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client). This is where the app will run in development.

## Running the App

```
npm start
```

The console will display a QR code.

On iOS, you can scan the QR code with the camera app. This will launch Expo Go.
On Android, you can launch Expo Go and scan the QR code from within Expo Go.

Once you've scanned the code once, you can launch Expo Go and the app will be listed in the "Recently Opened" list.
