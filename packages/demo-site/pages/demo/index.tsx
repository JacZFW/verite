        This demo captures 3 key sequences: issuance, verification, and
        revocation of credentials.

      <p className="mt-4">
        <strong>Basic issuance:</strong> Demonstrate how an issuer, such as
        Coinbase, issues a KYC and credit score credential to a customerâ€™s
        mobile (iOS) wallet, and describe the same process for browser
        (MetaMask) and hosted wallets.

      <p className="mt-4">
        <strong>Basic verification:</strong> Demonstrate how a verifier,
        including a DeFi smart contract as well as a central service such as
        Circle, requests proof of KYC and how the customer provides it using the
        previously-issued credential (show both web and mobile wallet).
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        <strong>Revocation:</strong> Demonstrate how an issuer such as Coinbase
        can revoke one of its previously-issued credentials.
