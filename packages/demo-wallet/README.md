# Verity Wallet

## Getting Started

See the [Setting up the development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) documentation for React Native CLI.

The instructions suggest using the default system ruby, but it works just as well with a version manager such as asdf.

First run and after updating dependencies, you will need to update NPM and CocoaPod dependencies:

```
npm install
cd ios
pod install
```

## Running the App

```
npm run ios
```
